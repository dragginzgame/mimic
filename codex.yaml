  rules:
    - "Prefer '?' over 'unwrap()'; handle errors explicitly."
    - "Keep public APIs documented; co-locate small unit tests."
    - "Do not modify pushed release tags."
    - "Keep changes minimal and focused; avoid unrelated fixes."
    - "Style: space out comments — add a blank line before comment blocks and around multi-line comments for readability."
    - "Style: prefer an explicit 'return' before the final line of a function to make the result stand out — but only when it does not trigger clippy warnings; otherwise keep idiomatic tail-expression."
    - "Do not change clippy/rustfmt settings to satisfy stylistic preferences; keep code clippy-clean."
