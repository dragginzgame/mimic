/// FNV-1a 64-bit hash (compile-time safe).
///
/// This variant is used only for **static, non-cryptographic identifiers** such as
/// schema or entity constants (e.g. `ENTITY_ID` in Mimic).
///
/// - ✅ **Deterministic** across compilers and platforms
/// - ✅ **`const fn`-compatible**, so hashes can be computed at compile time
/// - ⚙️ **Lightweight**: no dependencies, minimal CPU cost
/// - ⚠️ **Not cryptographically secure** — should *never* be used for
///   runtime routing, certified data, or signatures
///
/// For dynamic or security-sensitive hashing, use `xxhash64` (fast, uniform)
/// or `blake2b_256` (cryptographic) from `canic::hash`.
